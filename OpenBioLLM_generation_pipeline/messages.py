Current treatments include salicylic acid, cryotherapy, bleomycin, and immunotherapy; however, they have limitations of low-cure rates or side effects. Plantar warts treated with bee venom (BV) have not been reported. Here we present a case of a patient who showed complete remission of multiple plantar warts after BV treatment.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old boy experienced total of 16 plantar warts and visited department of dermatology of Korean Medicine. BV was injected into wart sites. Warts were completely removed at the end of the 8-week treatment with no adverse event recorded. There was improvement during the follow-up after 4 weeks.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first case of plantar warts that improved with BV injection. This study suggests that BV may be a therapeutic option for individuals who cannot receive cryotherapy due to pain during and after treatment or who have refractory or relapsed warts." '
